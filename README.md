## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for building applications with Kubernetes Service and VS Code. We only collect the following data:

* Usage information and error's diagnotic information.

We do not collect any information about image names, paths, etc. Read our [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) to learn more. If you donâ€™t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, you can set the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting to `false`.
